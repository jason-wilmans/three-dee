            Version number as described in http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning
            When using pre-release (alpha, beta, rc...etc.) and because the order of the release is in alphabetical order,
            please use a double digit like alpha00 alpha01...etc. in order to make sure that we will follow the correct
            order for the versions.
